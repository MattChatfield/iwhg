<p class="bodytext">The <a href="about.html">Isle of Wight Hedgerow Group</a> exists to encourage the planting
    of new hedges and the good management of existing ones, and to promote the
    art of hedgelaying. The group organises the annual <a href="competition.html">Isle
    of Wight Hedgelaying Competition</a> and is made up of individuals and organisations on the Isle of
    Wight who are interested in hedgerows. </p>
	
	 <p class="bodytext"> The IW hedgelaying competition has been run by the IW Hedgerow Group for many years. A separate competition is run by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wightnaturefundcharity">Wight Nature Fund</a>.</p>
	
<p class="bodytext"><a href="hedgelaying.html">Hedgelaying</a> is the traditional way of managing hedges throughout
 much of England and Wales. It creates a thick barrier from untidy, gappy and
    straggling hedges.&nbsp; <img src="graphics/polaroid/billhooks1.gif" alt="Billhooks" width="250" height="275" class="pictureboxleft" />Stems
    are cut most of the way through so that they can be bent over without damaging
    them. This traditional country skill declined for much of the 20th century,
    and at one time looked as though it would die out. However a revival
    in the late 20th century came from an influx of amateur hedgelayers who now
    keep the craft alive as a hobby, as well as a small but growing number of
    professionals who find their services in demand when landowners realise the
    aesthetic and historic value of a real laid hedge. </p>
