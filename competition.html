<p class="subheader">Each year, the Isle of Wight Hedgerow Group organises the
Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition.</p>

 <p class="bodytext"> The IW hedgelaying competition has been run by the IW Hedgerow Group for many years. A separate competition is run by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wightnaturefundcharity">Wight Nature Fund</a>.</p>

<p class="subheader">The following is the<a href="http://www.iwcp.co.uk/news/dicks-a-great-bet-for-hedges-15023.aspx"> report of the 2007 competition</a>, as

<p class="body">A
  RECORD number of spectators witnessed another captivating IW Hedgelaying Competition
  with people of all abilities pitting their skills against each other on Saturday.
  The 16th annual challenge, held at Blackwater Hollow, saw Godshill man Dick
  Pulleine make it a highly impressive four-in-a-row in the open competition. <span id="ctl00_MainContent_ctl00_lblContent" class="pictureboxleft"><img src="graphics/polaroid/chainsaw.gif" alt="Dick Pulleine does the finishing touches" width="250" height="275" /><br />
  Dick Pulleine carries out the finishing touches</span> Mr Pulleine, 57, of
    Bleak Down, who runs a coppicing business, retained the AONB Cup, making
    it his eighth success since 1993, the year the competition began.</p>
<p class="body"><em>&ldquo;There
  is no secret to my success. I do this kind of thing in the winter for a living &mdash; planting
  new hedgerows or refurbishing them,&rdquo;  </em>said
  Mr Pulleine. <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m well pleased with another win and enjoy some
    competition, though I have to say this year was one of the toughest I&rsquo;ve
    had to date. Taking part each year gives me a buzz and I always set out to
    win. With the cup, I also won a new chainsaw, which will do me nicely.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="body">  The judges, wood sculptor Paul Sivell and expert hedgelayer
    Alan Ashby, of Tunbridge Wells, had a tough task trying to pick a winner
    in the team event, which attracted nine entries. 
  IW Council countryside rangers Richard Temple, Karl Dyson and Nick Webb, who
  called themselves The Power Rangers, took part in the competition for the first
  time and won The Landscape Therapy Challenge Trophy. 
  In a day of firsts, National Trust head warden Robin Lang, 44, also won the
  novices event in his first-ever appearance in the contest, scooping The Mary
  Sitch Challenge Cup, a pruning saw and Hursts gift tokens for his efforts<em>.</em></p>
<p class="body"><em>&ldquo;I
  had always watched the competition and had been thinking about taking part
  for a long time, but never got round to it until this year. It
  was great fun, hedgelaying with people I know. It was a really nice atmosphere
  there and would have enjoyed taking part whether I had won or not,&rdquo; </em>he
  said.</p>
