<!--<p class="body">Two new hedgelaying champions lifted cups at Calbourne Mill when the annual Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition took place. Following heavy showers the field was a muddy one, but crowds of spectators visited the site throughout the day, enjoying the spectable and providing much-needed support for over forty people who took up their tools to lay. Undeterred by the wet ground, twenty-three pitches were laid in total in the Open, Novice and Team classes. Several teams from the mainland joined in, although the overall team champions were local favourites 'The Wench Layers', who became the first team ever to successfully defend their title, and did so in style, a full five points ahead of the second-placed team, father and son James and Josh Cook. </p>
 <p class="body">
Last year's novice champion, Rick Temple, was no longer eligible for that category and had to move up to the Open class. This meant that the Novice class was bound to be won by a new face and it was Alex Holmes who, after many years competing, finally took the Novice prize. It was a case of brotherly competition as impressive Jim and Noel Clinton took second and third places respectively. In the Open class there was the usual fierce struggle, with five of the best hedgelayers on the Island fighting it out for this most coveted award. There was a surprise as last year's champion Rob Richards had to make do with a distant third place - although he had the consolation of retaining the Hurst's Hand Tools prize for the best hedge laid with hand tools only. But Rob was six points behind Whitwell-based hedgelayer Oswald Hoskyns, who placed a confident second whilst overall 2011 Open champion Tom Murphy, of the landscaping firm Living Landscapes led the field by a further five points in one of the clearest victories seen in recent years.  </p>-->
