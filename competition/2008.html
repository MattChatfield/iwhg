<p class="body">The biggest competition yet was held in reasonably dry weather
	on a cauliflower field alonside the main Arreton-Sandown road. Fifteen pitches
	were cut, plus a demonstration pitch by Peter Tonks, a former supreme national
	champion. Other attractions included a demonstration of hurdle-making from
	local hurdler Richard Bolwell, and an impressive display of billhooks. </p>
<p class="body">The sizable crowd
	assembled for the results had a tense wait for the verdict as the three judges
	had to reinspect the pitches to determine the results of several ties. A
	remarkable upset occured when reigning champion Dick Pulleine was unexpectedly
	ousted from the top spot by Paul Davis, who has not competed in recent years.
	The novice class also saw a new winner, with Rob Richards, a regular competitor,
	picking up his first trophy - as well as the brand new W Hurst &amp; Sons cup
	for the best laid hedge with hand tools only. A big entry from the IW College
	guaranteed an exciting competition in the team class, with the usual range
	of students showing remarkable stamina ands skill. All the competitors earned
	their prizes!</p>
