<p class="body">Hedgelaying is the art of cutting a stem partly through so that
  it will bend without breaking and will continue to grow. <span class="pictureboxleft"><img src="graphics/polaroid/hedge1.gif" alt="newly laid hedge" width="250" height="275"><br>
  Newly laid hedge </span>The
  traditional way of managing hedges throughout large parts of England and Wales,
  hedgelaying was originally
  carried out to contain livestock, such as sheep and cows. Hedges are now
  primarily laid to enhance the appearance of the hedge and to maintain
  habitats for the birds, animals and flowers which so enrich our visits to the
  countryside. </p>
<p class="body">Hedgelaying involves cutting nearly all the way through the base
  of the stems and laying them over at an angle of about 35 degrees. The cut
  stems, called pleachers, are tucked tightly together and lay parallel to each
  other.&nbsp; Generally, hedges are then staked vertically and bound horizontally
  for strength and to achieve the thickest possible hedge. The hedgelayer can
  work with both hand tools and chainsaws, and normally stakes and binds the
  hedge with hazel. Managed in this way, hedges can last indefinitely.</p>
<p class="body"><span class="subheader">The origin of hedges and hedgelaying </span><br>
  Hedges in some form have existed as
  long as man has cleared woodland for agriculture. Documentary evidence proves
    that there were hedges in existence in AD 800 which can still be seen today
    in England. But the laying of hedges is more recent in origin, and is linked
    to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosure">process
  of Enclosure</a> which transformed the English landscape
  throughout the Middle Ages.  In
  1603 the first Act promoting enclosure was passed, to be followed by over 5,000
  separate Enclosure Acts enclosing over 7 million acres of open fields or common
  land. Enclosure acts specified that the plots of land they created be enclosed
  by hedges and ditches and maintained by the owner subsequently. </p>
<p class="body"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Rackham">Oliver
    Rackham</a> estimates that over 200,000 miles of hedge
  were planted between 1750 and 1850 and that this was as much as in the previous
500 years. Modern hedgelaying dates from that time in the eighteenth century.<span class="pictureboxright"><img src="graphics/polaroid/hedge2.gif" alt="newly laid hedge" width="250" height="275"><br>
  Newly laid hedge </span>
  The word &#8216;hedge&#8217; 
  derives from an earlier word meaning bank - the division between strips of
    land  in the mediaeval farming system. After the Enclosure acts,
    each  man had to dig a ditch to create a boundary, piling up the soil on
    his side  and planting bushes on the soil to keep livestock on his land.
    This &#8216;dogging 
  down and stocking up&#8217; was hard work so, when creating boundaries, the
   ditch was often left out (unless drainage was needed). Bushes were still planted
   and even if there was no bank they kept the name they have today: a
  hedge. </p>
<p class="body">Planting 'on the flat', as opposed to setting the hedge on a
  bank, was rare before the 19th century. It first came into common local use
  in Yorkshire's Vale of Pickering where as early as 1785 hedges were made by
  digging a trench, setting the plants along the vertical side and then backfilling.
  But it was the advent of the railways which encouraged flat planting, for the
  engineers preferred their hedges unbanked and often unditched as well. Soon
  farmers in many areas adopted this practice, which was cheaper and often made
  for better growth. The old 'bank and ditch' was finally outmoded. Flat planting
  gradually evolved in its turn so that the most usual modern method is 'ditch
  and hedge'. In this method a ditch is dug beside the hedge and the hedge is
planted on a bank which is so low as to be negligible compared to older banks.</p>
<p class="body">Although some started calling for a reduction in the number of
  hedges even as enclosure was still taking place, on the grounds of efficiency,
  the number of hedges did not start to decline significantly until after the
  Second World War. In 1946 there were an estimated 500,000 miles of hedge in
England. </p>
<p class="body"><span class="subheader">The decline of the hedgerow in England </span><br>
  Hedgerows can only survive
  in the long term with correct management. Today, neglect and incorrect management
  are responsible for more hedgerow loss than outright removal, which is now
  less than new hedge planting. </p>
<p class="body">It is estimated that there were 352,000 miles of hedge in England
  and Wales in 1984. By 1990 this had fallen to 270,000 miles and by 1993 to
  236,000. </p>
<p class="body"><span class="subheader">Resurgence of hedges and hedgelaying</span><br>
  Post-war agricultural policy
  changes gradually changed to reverse the loss of hedges through removal. A
  1993 survey by CPRE revealed that far more hedges were being planted and fewer
  actively removed than for 1984-90. <span class="pictureboxleft"><img src="graphics/polaroid/spring.gif" alt="Hedge 2 months after laying" width="250" height="275"><br>
  Hedge 2 months after laying </span>Hedgerow loss for the period 1990-93 was
  almost entirely due to changes of management, including neglect. However, by
  the latter part of twentieth century the value of hedgerows was well established,
  perhaps best illustrated in the enacting of the <a href="http://www.naturenet.net/trees/hedgerow/index.html">Hedgerow
  Regulations 1997</a> which give statutory protection to a limited number of
  important hedgerows. </p>
<p class="body">The popularity of the craft of hedgelaying, perhaps not surprisingly,
  has mirrored the decline and rise of hedgerows throughout this time. This
  traditional country skill declined for much of the 20th century, and at one
  time looked as though it might even die out. However a revival in the late
  20th century came from an influx of amateur hedgelayers who now keep the craft
  alive as a hobby, as well as a small but growing number of professionals who
  find their services in demand when landowners realise the aesthetic and historic
  value of a real laid hedge. </p>
<p class="body"><span class="subheader">The Isle of Wight Style</span><br>
  Hedges are laid in a<a href="http://handbooks.btcv.org.uk/handbooks/content/chapter/76"> variety
    of regional styles</a>. The Isle of
  Wight has its own style, which is now very rarely  practiced. In this style,
    the pleachers are laid fairly flat, to form a hedge roughly
    semi-circular in cross-section, about 3' high and about 2ft wide. The pleachers
    are secured by crooks set on either side. Most laid hedges
  on the Island are laid in South of England Style, including those laid during
    the IW Hedgelaying Competition.  </p>
