  Os Hoskyns </span>The
  Isle of Wight Hedgelaying Competition is a great day out. There is plenty to
  see and do. It's a perfect opportunity for you to see this ancient craft in
  action and there are always plenty of things to photograph. There are some
  pictures of recent Isle of Wight hedgelaying competitions on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/iwhg/">our
  Flickr photo group</a>.
  If you would like to use the images or would like a higher resolution version,
  please <a href="contact.html">contact</a> the Isle of Wight Hedgerow Group. </p>
